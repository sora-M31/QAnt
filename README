This is a programme simulating ants foraging behaviour based on pheromone model. The programme was written in C++ with OpenGL, QT creator under MacOS x86-64(Darwin). If you can't run the programme, there's a video demonstration here.

=Configuration=
Pheromone: attract to pheromone.
Attract: move towards food/home when close to food/home.
Avoid: avoid colliding with other ants.
Wall: make sure ants do not move outside of the world plane.

*It is suggested using a low pheromone rate to avoid forming a circle.Also There should be enought ants(like more than20) to achieve the "walking in a line" result.
